# Public Natural Gas Infrastructure Survey - Maine Cities

## Project Overview

This project aims to survey the public natural gas infrastructure across cities in Maine to document and map the locations of methane leaks. The project involves creating a database, extracting and transforming data collected by volunteers, and visualizing the results through interactive maps. These maps will help identify areas with potential gas leaks and support efforts to address environmental and public safety concerns.

## Goals

- **Survey public natural gas infrastructure** in Maine cities.
- **Document and map** the locations of methane leaks.
- **Provide visual insights** through interactive maps to help identify and address infrastructure issues.

## Project Steps

### 1. Database Creation

The first step in the project is to create a structured database to store the methane leak data collected by volunteers. This database will serve as the foundation for all subsequent data analysis and visualization tasks.

- **Technology Used:** SQLAlchemy for database management, SQLite as the database engine.
- **Tables:** The database includes tables for cities, utility providers, measurements, photos, and volunteers.

### 2. ETL Process

After the database is set up, the next step is to implement an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process. This process involves extracting data from a Google Sheet where volunteers have documented their methane measurements, transforming this data as needed, and loading it into the database.

- **Technology Used:** Python scripts to automate the ETL process, using libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and SQLAlchemy for database operations.
- **Data Source:** Google Sheet containing volunteer data on methane measurements.

### 3. Leak Mapping

The final step in the project is to create interactive maps that visualize the location of documented methane leaks. These maps will be saved as HTML files, making them easily shareable and viewable in any web browser.

- **Technology Used:** Folium and GeoPandas for mapping, Python for scripting the process.
- **Output:** HTML files containing interactive maps for each city, showing the location of methane leaks with detailed pop-ups.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the project environment:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/natural-gas-survey-maine.git
   cd natural-gas-survey-maine
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Install the required Python libraries using `pip`:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare data:**

   Ensure that your Google Sheets API credentials are available in the `credentials.json` file. Place this file in the root directory of the project.

## Usage

### 1. Create the Database

Run the database creation script to set up the database structure:

```sh
python create_database.py
```

This script will initialize the database with the necessary tables.

### 2. Run the ETL Pipeline

Execute the ETL pipeline to extract data from the Google Sheet, transform it, and load it into the database:

```sh
python etl_pipeline_driver.py
```

### 3. Generate Leak Maps

Finally, run the mapping script to generate HTML files containing maps that visualize the methane leaks:

```sh
python methane_leak_mapper.py
```

The generated maps will be saved in the `html/` directory and can be viewed in your web browser.
